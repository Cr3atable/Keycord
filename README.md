#Keycord - Simple Discord integration for Keybase
This project is dead but can still be ran for learning purposes or if anyone wants to make their own workaround for the issue of not getting Keybase's approval.  
Keycord acts as a mirror for messages in a Discord server to a publicly viewable web frontend to help Keybase interpret said messages as actual proofs.  
There is no config file as I never meant for the code to actually be public and don't want to make one. Everything is setup as it would be on the official website.
